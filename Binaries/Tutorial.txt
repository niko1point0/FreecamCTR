This only works with SCUS 94426 version of Crash Team Racing

Windows
Open FreecamCTR.exe, follow the directions, and it is ready for use when the 
cmd window has a blank screen. If you close the FreecamCTR window, and 
restart the race, it "might" go back to normal, and if it does not, then simply
restart the emulator

PSP
Install FreecamCTR.prx the way you'd install any other PRX to the seplugins folder,
open Crash Team Racing, wait until you get to main menu, then press Select to
activate Freecam. After that, enter a race and fly around. Freecam will be disabled
when you press the Home button

Use the D-Pad to move
Use shape buttons to rotate camera (cross, circle, triangle, square)
Use R1 to Rise, use L1 to Lower
Use Select to go fast (3x speed)

Sometimes the camera spawn upside down, to fix that simply hold Up or Down Arrow keys
until it eventually flips

Sometimes the camera spawns in the middle of nowhere, just hold Select to quickly 
get back to the track
