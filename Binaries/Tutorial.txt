Be sure to make a save state before running the EXE, because once you open the mod,
you can't turn off freecam without rebooting the emulator. To use the mod, open FreecamCTR,
then simply use WASD to move, R and F to rise and fall, then arrow keys to rotate

This is an early prototype, that was built in one hour, lots of room for improvement
The polygons drawn depends on where the kart is, not depending on where the camera is,
I know it's possible to change, not sure how yet
